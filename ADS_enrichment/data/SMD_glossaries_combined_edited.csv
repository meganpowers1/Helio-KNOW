At their largest, CMEs can contain 10 billion tons of matter, and they can move at speeds of a million miles an hour. Just after blowing into space, a CME cloud can grow as wide as 30 million miles across, 35 times the diameter of the sun.

aurora,"A faint visual phenomenon associated with geomagnetic activity that is visible mainly in the high-latitude night sky. Aurorae occur within a band of latitudes known as the auroral oval, the location of which is dependent on geomagnetic activity. Aurorae are a result of collisions between atmospheric gases and precipitating charged particles (mostly electrons) guided by the geomagnetic field from the magnetotail. Each gas (oxygen, nitrogen molecules, and atoms) emits a particular color depending on the energy of the precipitating particles, and atmospheric composition varies with altitude. Since the faster precipitating particles penetrate deeper, certain auroral colors, originate preferentially from certain heights in the sky. The auroral altitude range is 80 to 1000 km, but typical aurorae are 100 to 250 km above the ground; the color of the typical aurora is yellow-green, from a specific transition of atomic oxygen. Auroral light from lower levels in the atmosphere is dominated by blue and red bands from molecular nitrogen and oxygen. Above 250 km, auroral light is characterized by a red spectral line of atomic oxygen.  Aurorae in the Northern Hemisphere are called the aurora borealis or ”northern lights.” Aurorae in the Southern Hemisphere are called aurora australis. The patterns and forms of the aurora include quiescent arcs, rapidly moving rays, curtains, patches, and veils.",Space Weather Glossary.json,7

plasma,"The material in the sun and its atmosphere -- as well as the material in Earth's ionosphere, aurora and fluorescent lights -- are all plasmas. Plasma is a state of matter much like solid, liquid and gas. Plasmas are so incredibly hot, that the electrons leave their atoms, making it essentially a gas of charged particles. While uncommon on Earth, 99% of the matter we can see in the universe is made of plasma. The electrical charge strongly affects how the particles move, since the particles are simultaneously governed by, and constantly creating, magnetic fields. For example, in close-up images of solar activity you can see the plasma very clearly following the magnetic field lines. Conversely, as plasma moves, it drags its own magnetic fields along for the ride. This constant interchange is one reason why studying the dynamics of plasma on the sun or in the magnetosphere is so challenging.",NASA Heliophysics Vocabulary.json,5
solar energetic particles,"During an eruptive event on the sun, the sun can emit very fast, very energetic particles that travel at about 80% the speed of light. Such charged particles can reach Earth's magnetosphere either in the wake of a flare, or propelled ahead of a coronal mass ejection. In either case the energy they dump into the atmosphere can create what's called a solar radiation storm, which can cause low frequency radio blackouts at Earth.",NASA Heliophysics Vocabulary.json,5
solar flares,"A great burst of light and radiation due to the release of magnetic energy on the sun. Flares are by far the biggest explosions in the solar system, with energy releases comparable to billions of hydrogen bombs. The radiation from the flare travels at the speed of light, and so reaches Earth within eight minutes. The energy is generally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, which protects humans on Earth, however, the energy can cause radio blackouts on Earth for minutes or, in the worst cases, hours at a time. The radiation from a flare would also be harmful to astronauts outside of Earth's atmosphere. Some, but by no means all, flares have an associated coronal mass ejection (CME).",NASA Heliophysics Vocabulary.json,5
coronal hole,"An extended region of the corona, exceptionally low in density and associated with unipolar photospheric regions having ”open” magnetic field topology. Coronal holes are largest and most stable at or near the solar poles, and are a source of high-speed solar wind.

cosmic rays,"Extremely energetic atomic nuclei which travel through the Universe at practically the speed of light and strike the Earth from all direction. Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays.

cosmic rays,"Extremely energetic atomic nuclei which travel through the Universe at practically the speed of light and strike the Earth from all direction. Almost 90% of all the incoming primary cosmic rays are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). Some cosmic rays come from the Sun (mainly due to solar flares), most come from galactic supernovae, and a few with the highest energy are suspected to originate from outside the Milky Way. As for their flux, about 1 charged particle per second per cm^2 impacts the Earth. The typical kinetic energy of these particles is about 10 MeV/nucleon to several GeV/nucleon, although there are some at higher energies. In fact, the cosmic ray with the highest energy has been measured above x 10^20 eV. These ultra-high energy cosmic rays are suspected to be extragalactic, as there is no plausible mechanism of acceleration to these energies by a supernova, for example. Again, compare these energies to those of solar neutrinos that have only 0.26 MeV. Cosmic rays may be divided into primary cosmic rays and secondary cosmic rays. Their energy ranges from 10^9 to 10^20 electron-volts.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,5

protoplanetary disks,"A circumstellar disk of gas and dust surrounding a pre-main sequence star from which planetary systems form. Protoplanetary disks are remnants of accretion disks which bring forth stars. Typically, their sizes are ~100-500 AU, masses ~10^-2 solar masses, lifetimes ~10^6 - 10^7 years, and accretion rates ~10^-7 - 10^-8 solar masses per year. According to the standard theory of planet formation, called core accretion, planets come into being by the growth of dust grains which stick together and produce ever larger bodies, known as planetesimals. The agglomeration of these planetesimals of 100 to 1000 km in size into rocky Earth-mass planets is the main outcome of this theory. Beyond the snow line in the disk, if the masses of these cores of rock and ice grow higher than 10 times that of Earth in less than a few million years, gas can rapidly accrete and give rise to giant gaseous planets similar to Jupiter. If core building goes on too slowly, the disk gas dissipates before the formation of giant planets can start. Finally the left-over planetesimals that could not agglomerate into rocky planets or core of giant planets remain as a debris disk around the central object that has become a main sequence star. An alternative to core accretion theory is formation of planets in a massive protoplanetary disk by gravitational instabilities. The validity of these two theories is presently debated.

ionization,"Ionization is the physical process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion by changing the difference between the number of protons and electrons.

A positive electric charge is produced when an electron bond to an atom or molecule absorbs enough energy from an external source to escape from the electric potential barrier that originally confined it, where the amount of energy required is called the Ionization potential. A negative electric charge is produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently caught inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,4

The observed or dip poles, where the magnetic field is vertical to the Earth’s surface, are near 77 degrees N and 102 degrees W, and 65 degrees S and 139 degrees E. The adopted origin of geomagnetic longitude is the meridian passing through the geomagnetic poles (dipole model) and the geographic south pole.

kp index,"Kp is a common index used to indicate the severity of the global magnetic disturbances in near-Earth space. Kp is an index based on the average of weighted K indices at 13 ground magnetic field observatories. It is based on the range of the magnetic field variation within 3 hour intervals that is caused by phenomena other than the diurnal variation and the long-term components of the storm time variations. The values of the Kp range from 0 (very quiet) to 9 (very disturbed) in 28 discrete steps, resulting in values of 0, 0+, 1-, 1, 1+, 2-, 2, 2+,...9.
An Estimated Kp is calculated by NOAA in near-real-time.
The official, after-the-fact, 3-hourly planetary index of geomagnetic activity is calculated twice per month by the the German GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) (Research Center for Geosciences), from the K indexes observed at 13 stations primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. The Kp indices, which date from 1932, are used to determine the ap indices.",Space Weather Glossary.json,3

As a result, the central regions of clusters of galaxies cool down; and since in the center of a cluster gas pressure and gravitational attraction are in equilibrium, the gas density has to rise to maintain the pressure necessary for supporting the outer layers of gas. To cause its density to rise, the cooled gas has to flow inward. As the densest gas, which cools quickest, is already concentrated in the center of the cluster, the inward flow will start at the center, soon followed by the outer layers. This flow of gas is called the cooling flow. Cooling flows are moderated through feedback due to the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of the central galaxy.

hubble constant,"The Hubble parameter for the present epoch. It is the constant of proportionality between the recession velocities of galaxies and their distances from each other. The latest determinations using the Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheids give H_0 = 72 ± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, the WMAP observations yield 70.4 ± 1.3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and the Planck Satellite observations give 67.3 ± 1.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. More recently, the Hubble constant was derived by a team of astronomers, using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, with a 2.4% accuracy. The new value, 73.2 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, suggests that the Universe is expanding between five and nine percent faster than previously calculated.

europa,"The sixth of Jupiter's known moons and the fourth largest; it is the second of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3140 km, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Its mass is 4.80 × 10^22 kg, i.e. 1.5 times less massive than Earth Moon. Its distance to Jupiter is 670,900 km, or about 9 Jovian radii. Its orbital period is 3.55 Earth days which equals its rotation period. Europa's density is 3.0 g cm^-3, typical of a mixture of rocks including ice. Its high albedo (0.67) suggests that its surface is mostly water ice. The surface temperature of Europa ranges between about 125 K (-150 °C) at the equator and about 50 K (-220 °C) at the poles. There are few impact craters on Europa, because its surface is too active and therefore young. The most striking features of Europa's surface are structures called lineae and lenticulae. The thickness of the ice crust could range between a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. It is now believed that there is an ocean of salty water, up to 100 km deep, flowing under Europa's ice. Europa's ocean is kept liquid due to tidal heating by Jupiter.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3

io,"The fifth of Jupiter's known moons and the third largest. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites. With a diameter of 3630 km, Io is slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It revolves at a mean distance of 422,000 km from Jupiter. Its mass is 8.93 x 10^22 kg (about 1.2 Earth Moons) and its orbital period 1.8 Earth days. The mean surface temperature of Io is -155 °C. Io's yellow color derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock. The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes. The intense tidal force of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons. The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing molten rock to explode through the surface. Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out. Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3
triton,"The seventh and the largest of Neptune's satellites. It has a diameter of 2,700 km and orbits its planet at a mean distance of 354,760 km every 5.877 days. Triton was discovered by William Lassell in 1846 scarcely a month after Neptune was discovered. Triton is colder than any other measured object in the solar system with a surface temperature of -235° C. It has an extremely thin atmosphere. Nitrogen ice particles might form thin clouds a few kilometers above the surface. The atmospheric pressure at Triton's surface is about 15 microbars, 0.000015 times the sea-level surface pressure on Earth. Triton is the only large satellite in the solar system to circle a planet in a retrograde motion, that is in a direction opposite to the rotation of the planet.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3
titan,"The largest and the sixth moon of Saturn discovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. Called also Saturn VI. Titan has a diameter of 5,150 km, about half the size of Earth and almost as large as Mars. It orbits Saturn at a mean distance of 1,221,830 km every 15.945 days. It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere. Its surface temperature is -179 °C, which makes water as hard as rocks and allows methane to be found in its liquid form. Its surface pressure is slightly higher than Earth's pressure (1.6 bars against 1 bar at sea level). The Huygens probe released from Cassini-Huygens landed on Titan on December 25, 2004. From the data obtained by Cassini-Huygens, we know that Titan is a world with lakes and seas composed of liquid methane and ethane near its poles, with vast, arid regions not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid water ice coated with hydrocarbons that fall from the atmosphere. Titan's icy dunes are gigantic, reaching, on average, 1 to 2 km wide, hundreds kilometers long and around 100 m high. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids flowing across its surface as the planet cycles through its seasons. Each Titan season lasts about 7.5 Earth years. The Huygens probe made the first direct measurements of Titan's lower atmosphere. Huygens also directly sampled aerosols in the atmosphere and confirmed that carbon and nitrogen are their major constituents. Cassini followed up Huygens' measurements from orbit, detecting other chemicals that include propylene and poisonous hydrogen cyanide, in Titan's atmosphere. Cassini's gravity measurements of Titan revealed that this moon is hiding an internal, liquid water and ammonia ocean beneath its surface. Huygens also measured radio signals during its descent that strongly suggested the presence of an ocean 55 to 80 km below the moon's surface.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3

jupiter,"The largest planet in the Solar System and the fifth from the Sun, lying at a mean distance of about 5.2 astronomical units from the Sun. Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly hydrogen and helium, with a mass of 1.898 x 10^27 kg, or about 0.001 solar masses, or 318 times Earth masses. It is more than twice as massive as all the other solar system planets combined. Jupiter's diameter measures 11 times that of Earth. Its rotation period, 9.93 hours (Jupiter/Earth ratio = 0.41), is the shortest of all the solar system planets. Its orbital period is 11.857 Earth years. Jupiter has an extensive family of satellites (79 known) and a faint ring system; Jupiter's ring. Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting to something like 10 to 15 Earth masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures about 3 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Under the extreme pressure found deep inside Jupiter, the electrons are released from the hydrogen molecules and are free to move about the interior. This causes hydrogen to behave as a metal; it becomes conducting for both heat and electricity.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3
neptune,"The eighth planet from the Sun and the fourth largest by size in the solar system. The equatorial radius of Neptune is 24,764 km (3.883 Earths), its semi-major axis is 30.11 astronomical units (4.50 x 10^9 km), and its orbital period is 164.8 yr. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest ones are Triton, Proteus, and Nereid, whereas its smaller moons are: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso. Neptune has an incredibly thick atmosphere comprised of 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and approximately 1% methane. Particles of icy methane in its upper atmosphere give Neptune its deep blue color. Large storms whirl through Neptune's upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 m/s, fastest recorded in the solar system. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. Called the Great Dark Spot, it lasted about five years. Neptune has a very thin collection of rings. They are likely made up of ice particles mixed with dust grains and possibly coated with a carbon-based substance.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3
saturn,"The sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest with an equatorial diameter of 120,536 km orbiting at an average distance of 1,429,400,000 km (9.54 astronomical units) from Sun. With an eccentricity of 0.05555, its distance from the Sun ranges from 1.35 billion km (9.024 AU) at its perihelion to 1.509 billion km (10.086 AU) at its aphelion. Its average orbital speed being 9.69 km/s, it takes Saturn 29.457 Earth years (or 10,759 Earth days) to complete a single revolution around the Sun. However, Saturn also takes just over 10 and a half hours (10 hours 33 minutes) to rotate once on its axis. This means that a single year on Saturn lasts about 24,491 Saturnian solar days. Saturn has a mass of 5.6836 x 1026 kg (95.159 Earth masses) and a mean density of 0.687 g cm^(-3). Like Jupiter, Saturn is about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium with traces of water, methane, and ammonia, similar to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the solar system was formed. The temperature on Saturn is ~ -185 °C. Like Jupiter, Saturn has a solid core of iron-nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). The core has an estimated mass of 9-22 Earth Masses and a diameter of about 25,000 km (about 2 Earth diameter). The core is enveloped by a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a molecular hydrogen layer. Saturn's interior is hot (12,000 K at the core). The planet radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Most of the extra energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism as in Jupiter. Saturn has 62 known satellites.

uranus,"The seventh planet from the Sun and the third largest, discovered by William Herschel in 1781. It has a diameter about 51,100 km, four times that of the Earth, and a mass 14.5 times Earth's mass. Uranus orbits the Sun at a distance over 19 times the Earth-Sun distance. Although it takes about 84 years for Uranus to make a revolution, it completes a fast rotation in only 17 and a half hours. Unlike the other planets, its axis of rotation lies mostly in the plane of the Solar System. Uranus is internally less active than the other giant planets, which added to its larger distance from the Sun, makes it colder. It has a dense atmosphere made of mostly molecular hydrogen (83 percent) and helium (15 percent), with two percent methane and traces of acetylene and other hydrocarbons. The planet's greenish-blue color is due to light scattering as in Earth's sky and the absorption of red light by its small amount of atmospheric methane. Uranus has a ring system and 27 known satellites.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,3

Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth's diameter, 80% of Earth's mass). Its chemical composition and density are comparable to those of the Earth. It takes Venus just under 224.401 days to orbit the Sun, compared to the 365 day orbital period of the Earth. Venus' rotation is retrograde, that is it actually rotates from east to west, as opposed to west to east (prograde) which is the common rotating direction of most other planets. Seen from Venus, the sun would rise in the west and set in the east. Moreover, it takes about 244 Earth days for Venus to rotate once (sidereal rotation). This is longer than its orbital period. The length of its solar day is about 117 Earth days. Venus rotation. Its axial tilt is only three degrees, so there are no seasons on Venus.

t dwarfs,"A type of brown dwarf with an effective temperature between about 1200 K and 500 K, i.e. colder than the preceding type L dwarf. The spectra of T dwarfs are characterized by the presence of methane bands in the near infrared. The presence of these bands, broad H_{2}O features, and H_2 collision-induced absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of T dwarfs compared to a black body at the same temperature. Hence near-infrared colors become increasingly blue (J - K ~ 0) as compared to L dwarfs. The first T dwarf, called Gl 229B, was discovered by Nakajima et al.

The prototype, AM Canum Venaticorum, with a period of 17 minutes, was discovered in 1967. AM CVn stars are semidetached binary systems in which accretion is going on. The donor star is hydrogen deficient and the accretor is usually a white dwarf. To fit within their Roche lobes, the donor stars must be dense, suggesting they may be degenerate too.

Thus it is convenient for specifying the location of ground stations and ground-based experiments as these are fixed quantities in the GEO system.

When GEO coordinates are expressed in spherical form, the latitude component is identical what is termed geocentric latitude by astronomers and geographers. However, note that this is different to the system of geodetic latitude used in normal map-making. The geodetic latitude at any location is the angle between the equatorial plane and the local normal to the Earth's surface. In general that normal is NOT parallel to a radius vector because the shape of the Earth is an oblate spheroid and not a sphere.",HELIO Ontology.json,2
gei,"This system has its Z axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis (positive to the North) and its X axis towards the First Point of Aries (the direction in space defined by the intersection between the Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of its orbit around the Sun (the plane of the ecliptic). This system is (to first order) fixed with respect to the distant stars. It is convenient for specifying the orbits (and hence location) of Earth-orbiting spacecraft as one can specify a Keplerian orbit in this frame.

However note that the GEI system is subject to second order change with time owing to the various slow motions of the Earth's rotation axis with respect to the fixed stars. Thus for GEI coordinates one must specify the date (normally termed the epoch) to which the coordinate system applies. For space physics work one should use the epoch-of-date GEI system, i.e. the system applying at the same time as the data were taken. (Thus the rotation axis in GEI is identical with the GEO rotation axis.)",HELIO Ontology.json,2

general relativity,"The theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein (1916) that describes the gravitation as the space-time curvature caused by the presence of matter or energy. Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

accretion,"The process by which an object increases its mass under the influence of its gravitational attraction. Accretion plays a key role in a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. In particular stars result from the accretion of material by a protostar from a surrounding molecular cloud. The accumulation of mass on the protostar involves the formation of an accretion disk. Theoretical and observational investigations of protostars and newborn stars indicate the important role of magnetic fields in this process. They favor the magnetospheric accretion model for mass transfer from the circumstellar disk onto the newborn star. In this model, the stellar magnetosphere truncates the disk at a few stellar radii. Gas from the disk accretes onto the star along the magnetic field lines and hits the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity, causing a strong accretion shock. Various emission lines are formed in the infalling magnetospheric flow. Moreover, optical/ultraviolet excess continuum emission is produced in the accretion shocks.

pulsars,"A rotating neutron star that emits a radio beam that is centered on the magnetic axis of the neutron star. As the magnetic axis and hence the beam are inclined to the rotation axis, a pulse is seen every time the rotation brings the magnetic pole region of the neutron star into view. In this way the pulsar acts much as a light house does, sweeping a beam of radiation through space. The pulse or spin periods range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds. As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies (0.1-1 GHz), is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar (magnetosphere). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate. ",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

In the proton-proton chain, occurring in 86% of the cases, two Helium-3 nuclei fuse to a final Helium-4 nucleus while two protons are released. The mass of the resulting Helium-4 nucleus is less than the total mass of the four original protons. The difference, ~ 0.7% of the total mass of the protons, is converted into energy and radiated by the Sun. In this process, the Sun loses some 4 million tons of its mass each second.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

general relativity,"The theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein (1916) that describes the gravitation as the space-time curvature caused by the presence of matter or energy. Mass creates a gravitational field which distorts the space and changes the flow of time. In other words, mass causes a deviation of the metric of space-time continuum from that of the 'flat' space-time structure described by the Euclidean geometry and treated in special relativity. General relativity developed from the principle of equivalence between gravitational and inertial forces. According to general relativity, photons follow a curved path in a gravitational field. This prediction was confirmed by the measurements of star positions near the solar limb during the total eclipse of 1919. The same effect is seen in the delay of radio signals coming from distant space probes when grazing the Sun's surface. Moreover, the space curvature caused by the Sun makes the perihelion of Mercury's orbit advance by 43'' per century more than that predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. The perihelion advance can reach several degrees per year for binary pulsar orbits. Another effect predicted by general relativity is the gravitational reddening. This effect is verified in the redshift of spectral lines in the solar spectrum and, even more obviously, in white dwarfs. Other predictions of the theory include gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and the invariance of Newton's gravitational constant.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

milky way galaxy,"A spiral galaxy, of which the solar system is a small part. It is the second largest in our Local Group of galaxies. The Milky Way is a disk-shaped system, with a diameter of between 80,000 and 100,000 light-years and a thickness of about 2,000 light-years, containing more than 10^11 stars. The stars are divided into two main categories, Population II stars and Population I stars. The core, or nucleus, of the Galaxy is surrounded by an ellipsoidal central bulge that measures some 15,000 light-years in diameter and about 6,000 light-years in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk. Surrounding the bulge and extending in a near spherical distribution above and below the Galactic plane is the Galactic halo. The halo contains about 200 globular clusters and an extremely thinly scattered population of individual stars. The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

The Sun is located just over half way out from the center to the edge of the disk at a distance of about 25,000 light-years. In common with other stars, the Sun revolves around the Galactic Center. Its orbital velocity is about 220 km s^-1 and its orbital period is about 225 million years. Overall, the Galaxy exhibits differential rotation, that is stars and gas clouds closer to the center have shorter orbital periods than those that are located further out. The spiral arms of the Milky Way lie within its disk, where bright young stars, H II regions, and molecular clouds of gas and dust are concentrated into curved 'arms' that appear to radiate from the central bulge in a spiral pattern. The Galaxy's spiral pattern consists of several major arms and a number of shorter segments, one of which, the Orion arm, contains the Sun and the Orion star-forming region. Near-infrared observations have shown that the stars in the central bulge are arranged in an elongated galactic bar, about twice as long as it is wide, that is seen nearly end on from the present location of the solar system. The exact center, or nucleus, of the Galaxy coincides with a strong source of radio emission, called Sagittarius A, that is less than 15 astronomical units in diameter. Observations of the speeds at which clouds of ionized gas are revolving round the Galactic center imply that several million solar masses of material are concentrated within a region of about one light-year in radius. Since only about half of this mass can be accounted for by stars, it seems likely that the balance (about 2.5 million solar masses) is contained in a central black hole and that accretion onto this black hole is the underlying source of the energy radiated by Sagittarius A. The Milky Way also has a dark matter component. The Galactic rotation curve indicates that there is a large amount of invisible non-baryonic surrounding the whole Galaxy.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

The existence of dark matter is deduced mainly from the rotational speeds of galaxies, velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter plays also a central role in cosmic structure formation. There exists a large number of non-baryonic dark matter candidates.

While some of the gas has been stripped out of galaxies, it is also likely that some is also primordial in nature, and has been accreted into the clusters. The origin of the ICM is subject of intense investigation. Broadly, two possibilities have been envisaged. The first one considers the intracluster gas to be once contained in galaxies and later driven in the ICM. This would explain several observations: the presence of high metallicity gas, and H I deficiency of galaxies residing in the cores of rich clusters (which suggests that gas stripping has occurred). Alternatively, the ICM is primordial, originating at the time of cluster formation. Actually the ICM may result from a combination of both scenarios.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

seyfert galaxies,"A member of an important class of active galaxies which are characterized by the presence of an intensely bright nucleus in the optical wavelengths (10^9-10^12 L_sun) displaying emission spectral lines. The presence of these emission features, which are not seen in the spectra of normal galaxies, indicates a very high degree of ionization. Moreover, the nucleus radiates non-thermal continuum emission extending over the whole electromagnetic spectrum. It is thought that a massive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy accretes gas (accretion) from its surrounding environment to power Seyfert galaxies. These galaxies are divided into two types according to the width of their spectral lines. Type 1 Seyfert (Sy 1) galaxies have very broad emission lines (10^3 - 10^4 km s^-1), while Type 2 Seyferts (Sy 2) show relatively narrow lines (several hundred km s^-1). These spectral differences may be the result of viewing the nucleus from different angles. A Type 2 Seyfert galaxy may be a mostly edge-on view of matter spiraling in toward the supermassive black hole, whereas a Type 1 Seyfert provides a more pole-on view, allowing us to see the more turbulent region around the black hole.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

The HMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole paired with a massive star. Often, the stellar companion is a Be star, Be star, which sometimes sheds material from its equatorial region. In these systems, the transient event is characterized by having more higher energy X-rays in the spectrum. The LMXBs contain a neutron star or black hole orbiting around a cooler, low-mass star.

metallicity,"In a star, nebula, or galaxy, the proportion of the material that is made up of metals, that is elements heavier than helium. It is generally denoted by Z. The term 'metallicity' is a misnomer used in astrophysics.  In practice, the metallicity of stars is usually expressed by the number ratio of iron atoms to hydrogen atoms per unit volume, with respect to the solar values: [Fe/H] = log10(NFe/NH)star - log10(NFe/NH)Sun, where NFe and NH are the numbers of iron and hydrogen atoms per unit volume. In fact it is taken to be equal to the iron abundance with respect to the solar value. The solar logarithmic iron abundance is 7.50 ± 0.04, with respect to that of hydrogen which, by convention, is 12.00. Stellar metallicity is often expressed in mass fraction.

The right ascension is always measured eastward from the vernal equinox, in the units of hours, minutes, and seconds. Declination is the angle between the celestial equator and the position of the star measured along the star's hour circle. It is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds north or south of the celestial equator. By definition, the vernal equinox is located at right ascension 0h and declination 0°.

meteors,"A streak of light caused when a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere and becomes incandescent, mostly from friction with the air at high speed. Meteors are also referred to as shooting stars. Very bright meteors are called fireball or bolide. Most of visible meteors arise from particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is mainly caused by the meteoroid's high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere at high speeds (11-72 km/s). The increase in the number of meteors visible toward the end of the night results from the fact that the Earth rotates about its axis in the same direction as it orbits the Sun. This means that the leading edge (morning side) of the Earth encounters more meteoroids than the trailing edge (evening side). In general, 2 to 3 times as many meteors can be seen in the hour or so just before morning twilight, than can be seen in the early evening. Moreover, the numbers of random, or sporadic, meteors vary from season to season, due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis and other factors.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

pulsars,"A rotating neutron star that emits a radio beam that is centered on the magnetic axis of the neutron star. As the magnetic axis and hence the beam are inclined to the rotation axis, a pulse is seen every time the rotation brings the magnetic pole region of the neutron star into view. In this way the pulsar acts much as a light house does, sweeping a beam of radiation through space. The pulse or spin periods range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds. As neutron stars concentrate an average of 1.4 solar masses on a diameter of only 20 km, pulsars are exceedingly dense and compact, representing the densest matter in the observable Universe. The pulsar radiation, chiefly emitted in radio frequencies (0.1-1 GHz), is highly polarized. The exact mechanism by which a pulsar radiates is still a matter of vigorous investigation. Simply put, an enormous electric field is induced by the rotation of a magnetized neutron star. The force of this field exceeds gravity by ten to twelve orders of magnitudes. Charged particles are whereby pulled out from the stellar surface resulting in a dense, magnetized plasma that surrounds the pulsar (magnetosphere). The charged particles flow out of the magnetic polar caps of the neutron star, following the open magnetic field lines. The acceleration of the charged particles along the curved magnetic field lines will cause them to radiate. ",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

white dwarf stars,"A compact star of high surface temperature, low luminosity, and high density (10^5 - 10^8 g cm^-3), with roughly the mass of the Sun (mean mass ~ 0.6 M_sun) and the radius of the Earth (R ~ 0.01 R_sun), representing the end-point of the evolution of all stars with masses less then ~ 5-9 solar masses. A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

supernovae,"A violent stellar explosion which blows off all or most of the star's material at high velocity leaving a compact stellar remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion.

white dwarf stars,"A compact star of high surface temperature, low luminosity, and high density (10^5 - 10^8 g cm^-3), with roughly the mass of the Sun (mean mass ~ 0.6 M_sun) and the radius of the Earth (R ~ 0.01 R_sun), representing the end-point of the evolution of all stars with masses less then ~ 5-9 solar masses. A white dwarf is what remains after the central star of a planetary nebula fades and becomes cool. The Chandrasekhar limit of 1.43 solar masses is the highest mass that a white dwarf can achieve before electron degeneracy pressure is unable to support it. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, white dwarfs form a well-defined sequence around 8 magnitudes fainter than the main sequence. They are composed of a core of carbon and oxygen nuclei and degenerate electrons surrounded by a thin shell of helium and an outer skin of hydrogen. White dwarf's radiation is the leftover heat from the star's past when its core was an active nuclear reactor. The star slowly cools as heat escapes through the non-degenerate envelope. The first white dwarf to be discovered was Sirius B, the companion of Sirius. White dwarfs are divided into several types, according to their spectral features, which depend on the type of shell burning that dominated as it became a planetary nebula: DA white dwarf; DB white dwarf; DC white dwarf; DO white dwarf; DZ white dwarf; DQ white dwarf.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

Ionized helium (mainly He II 4541 Å) first appears at about B0. Most metallic lines are absent or weak, except some absorption lines for the higher ionization states of silicon, oxygen, carbon, and magnesium. These are hot stars with effective temperatures ranging from about 10,000 K at B9 to nearly 30,000 K at B0. They are between 3 and 20 solar masses.

The spectrum of early type G stars, such as the Sun (G2), is dominated by ionized lines of calcium (H and K lines, mainly) and neutral metals. In later type G stars the molecular bands of CH molecules and CN molecules become visible. The main sequence and giant stars have masses of ~ 1 solar mass, while the supergiants are of ~ 10 solar masses.

The effective temperatures of these stars range from about 30,000 K to 50,000 K, their luminosities from 50,000 to 1,000,000 times that of solar luminosity, and their masses from about 20 to 100 solar masses. The hottest O-type stars display high ionization emission features such as N III and He II, Of star. They are divided into subtypes O2, the hottest, to O9.7, the coldest. O-type stars are relatively rare, for each star of 100 solar masses there are 10^6 stars of solar mass. They are relatively short-lived since they spend only a few million years on the main sequence. The brightest O-type star in the sky visible with naked eye is Alnitak.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

supernovae,"A violent stellar explosion which blows off all or most of the star's material at high velocity leaving a compact stellar remnant such as a neutron star or black hole. At maximum light, the supernova can have luminosity about 108 or 109 times the solar luminosity. The phenomenon results from the later evolution of stars when an instability sets in the core following the nucleosynthesis of iron. In massive stars, the supernova occurs when the star has used up all its available nuclear fuel and it reaches a lower energy state through gravitational collapse to form a more compact object. In white dwarfs forming binary systems, accretion of mass onto the surface of a neutron star can be sufficient to take the star over the upper mass limit for stability as a white dwarf. Consequently, the white dwarf collapses in a supernova explosion to form a neutron star. There are several supernova types.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

type ia supernovae,"A Type I supernova that presents a singly-ionized silicon (Si II) absorption feature at 6150 Å near peak brightness. Type Ia SNe are believed to result from mass accretion to a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. When the white dwarf mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the degenerate electron pressure can no longer support the accumulated mass and the star collapses in a thermonuclear explosion producing a supernova. The peak luminosity of SNe Ia is set by the radioactive decay chain, and the observed photometric correlation between the peak luminosity and the time-scale over which the light curve decays from its maximum is understood physically as having both the luminosity and opacity being set by the mass of Nickel-56 synthesized in the explosion. Type Ia supernovae occur in all types of galaxies. Type Ia SNe are used as standard candles in determining cosmological distances, after normalizing their light curves with the Phillips relation.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,2

Because the earth rotates on its axis, the altitude and azimuth of a celestial body are constantly changing.",HELIO Ontology.json,1

carrington coordinate system,"Carrington heliographic coordinates One of two heliographic coordinate systems used for identifying the position of features on the Sun's surface. In the Carrington system, lines of longitude rotate with the Sun. A prime meridian, analogous to the Greenwich meridian on Earth, was defined to coincide with the central meridian of the Sun (as seen from Earth) at a specific time on 1853November9 when R. C.Carrington began his observations. A new Carrington rotation begins each time the prime meridian crosses the central meridian. The rotation period of the coordinate system varies throughout the year because of the changing distance of the Earth from the Sun, with an average value of 27.2753 days (the mean synodic period). This corresponds to a sidereal rotation period of 25.38 days. The Carrington longitude of the central meridian is 360� at the beginning of the Carrington rotation, and decreases to zero at the end. The longitude of a feature on the Sun (such as a sunspot) remains approximately constant in the Carrington system, in contrast to the Stonyhurst system.",HELIO Ontology.json,1
dipole meridian coodrindate system,"As with the solar magnetic system, the Z-axis of the dipolde meridian system (DM) is chosen alogn the north magnetic dipole axis. However, the Y-axis is directed outwards from the dipole. This is a local coordinate system, in that it varies with position, however, since the X-Z plane contains the dipole magnetic field it si quite useful

Uses
It si used to order data controlled by the dipole magnetic fiedl where the influence of the solar wind interaction with the magnetospere is weak. It has been used extensively to descripbe the distortions of the magnetospheric field in terms of the two angels declination and inclination whcih can be easily derived from measurements in this system.",HELIO Ontology.json,1

We note that since the X-axis is in the ecliptic plane and therefore is not necessarily in the Sun's equatorial plane, the Z-axis of this system will not necessarily be parallel to the Sun's axis of rotation. However, the Sun's axis of rotation must lie in the X-Z plane. The Z-axis is chosen to be in the same sense as the ecliptic pole, i.e. northwards.",HELIO Ontology.json,1

geothermal,"In geology, geothermal refers to heat sources within the planet. Strictly speaking, geo-thermal necessarily refers to the Earth but the concept may be applied to other planets. Geothermal is technically an adjective (e.g., geothermal energy) but in U.S. English the word has attained frequent use as a noun (otherwise expressed as g. heat, g. source, or geotherm). The planet's internal heat was originally generated during its accretion, due to gravitational binding energy, and since then additional heat has continued to be generated by the radioactive decay of elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium. The heat flow from the interior to the surface is only 1/20,000 as great as the energy received from the Sun.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

root,"n vascular plants, the root is the organ of a plant body that typically lies below the surface of the soil (compare with stem). However, this is not always the case, since a root can also be aerial (that is, growing above the ground) or aerating (that is, growing up above the ground or especially above water). On the other hand, a stem normally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see rhizome). So, it is better to define root as a part of a plant body that bears no leaves, and therefore also lacks nodes. There are also important internal structural differences between stems and roots. The two major functions of roots are 1.) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients and 2.) anchoring the plant body to the ground. Roots also function in cytokinin synthesis, which supplies some of shoot needs. They often function in storage of food. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizas, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

mafic,"Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or rock that is rich in magnesium and iron; the term was derived by contracting ‘magnesium’ and ‘ferric’. Most mafic minerals are dark in color and the specific gravity is greater than 3. Common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. Common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro. In terms of chemistry, mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the felsic rocks. The term roughly corresponds to the older basic rock class.Mafic lava, before cooling, has a low viscosity, in comparison to felsic lava, due to the lower silica content in mafic magma. Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava, so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic lava eruptions. Most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes, like Hawaii. [Wikipedia]",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

Noctilucent clouds are now known to consist of tiny ice particles with dimensions of the order of tens of nanometers, growing in the extreme cold of the summer polar mesopause region. The condensation nuclei on which the particles grow are thought to be either smoke and dust particles of meteoric origin or large hydrated positive ions. Strong upwelling of air from below, associated with a pole-to-pole meridional circulation in the upper mesosphere, is responsible for both the extreme cold and the upward flux of water vapor. Although water-vapor mixing ratios are very low (less than 10 parts per million by volume) in the region, the temperatures are also low enough to produce a high degree of supersaturation at times.

monsoon depression,"A depression that forms within the monsoon trough. The term is most frequently used to describe weak cyclonic disturbances that form over the Bay of Bengal and generally track northwestward over the Indian subcontinent. These occasionally intensify into tropical cyclones if they remain over warm ocean water long enough. The term is also used to describe depressions that form within the monsoon trough near Australia and in the western North Pacific region. The term has gained ascendancy in use to refer to a broad tropical cyclonic vortex characterized by 1) its large size, where the outermost closed isobar may have a diameter on the order of 600 n mi (1000 km); 2) a loosely organized cluster of deep convective elements, which may form an elongated band of deep convection in the east semicircle; 3) a low- level wind distribution that features a 100 n mi (200 km) diameter light-wind core, which may be surrounded by a band of gales or contain a highly asymmetric wind field; and 4) a lack of a distinct cloud system center.

local wind,"1. Winds that, over a small area, differ from those that would be appropriate to the general large-scale pressure distribution, or that possess some other peculiarity. Often these winds have names unique to the area where they occur. Local winds may be classified into three main groups. The first includes diurnally varying airflows that are driven by local gradients of surface heat flux (e.g., near the shore of a sea or lake) or by diurnal heating or cooling of the ground surface in areas of sloping or mountainous terrain. These include land and sea breezes, mountain?valley circulations, and drainage and slope winds. The second group consists of winds produced by the interaction of a synoptic-scale flow with orography. These may be further subdivided into barrier jets, gap winds, downslope windstorms, and include such local phenomena as the tehuantepecer, Santa Ana, foehn, mistral, and bora. The third group includes those winds accompanying convective activity, more specifically individual thunderstorms or mesoscale convective systems. These are generally the surface manifestations of precipitation- cooled diverging outflow and in some locations are given special names due to the distinctive character of the weather associated with them (e.g., the haboob). 2. Local or colloquial names given to frequently occurring or particularly noteworthy winds (sometimes because of the bad weather associated with them), usually from a certain direction.

There they have been defined as ?a flow of air in a sea level channel that accelerates under the influence of a pressure gradient parallel to the axis of the channel.? As in the case of mountain- gap winds, this term has also been applied to pressure-gradient winds accelerating through a gap in a mountain barrier.

mesojet,"A mesoscale wind maximum. It typically may have an along-flow length scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers and a cross- flow length scale of 100 km. Mesojets differ from planetary-scale jets, which can have length scales of several thousand kilometers, and synoptic-scale jets, which may have length scales of 1000? 2000 km and are commonly found in association with progressive synoptic-scale troughs and ridges. Larger mesojets may also sometimes be known as jet streaks. Mesojets can form adjacent to prominent orographic features in association with terrain-channeled flow. Mesojets are also seen in association with organized mesocale convective systems as typified by the evaporatively driven rear-inflow jet commonly found behind active squall lines lines.

mountain gap wind,"A local wind blowing through a gap between mountains, a gap wind. This term was introduced by R. S. Scorer (1952) for the surface winds blowing through the Strait of Gibraltar. When air stratification is stable, as it usually is in summer, the air tends to flow through the gap from high to low pressure, emerging as a ?jet? with large standing eddies in the lee of the gap. The excess of pressure on the upwind side is attributed to a pool of cold air held up by the mountains. Similar winds occur at other gaps in mountain ranges, such as the tehuantepecer and the jochwinde, and in long channels, such as the Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Olympic Mountains of Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

habitat fragmentation,"Habitat fragmentation is a process of environmental change important in evolution and conservation biology. As the name implies, it describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred environment (habitat). Habitat fragmentation can be caused by geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment or by human activity such as land conversion, which can alter the environment on a much faster time scale. The former is suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation. The latter is causative in extinctions of many species. Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when native vegetation is cleared for human activities such as agriculture, rural development or urbanization. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by crop land, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of slash and burn farming in tropical forests. The term habitat fragmentation can be considered to include six discrete processes: Reduction in the total area of the habitat, increase in the amount of edge, decrease in the amount of interior habitat, isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat, breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches, and Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

eddy,"In fluid dynamics, an eddy is the swirling of a fluid and the reverse current created when the fluid flows past an obstacle. The moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream-flowing water on the downstream side of the object. Fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a swirl of fluid on each edge of the obstacle, followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream, toward the back of the obstacle.

Above a surface, a laminar layer will develop and fluid velocity will increase with distance from the surface, but not indefinitely.

In the real world, most laminar boundary layers are extremely thin (order of 1 mm), but can be of biological importance, for example, next to plant leaves or as invertebrate refuges in streams.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1
laminar flow,"(Also called sheet flow, streamline flow.) A flow regime in which fluid motion is smooth and orderly, and in which adjacent layers or laminas slip past each other with little mixing between them. Exchange of material across laminar layers occurs by molecular diffusion, a process about 106 times less effective than turbulence. Laminar flow can be easily predicted as velocity increases at a steady rate from a boundary. This contrasts with the chaotic and random nature of turbulent flow. Laminar flow is not a common occurrence in the statically neutral and unstable atmosphere and is confined to a very thin layer (1 mm) adjacent to very smooth surfaces such as snow and ice. However, in strongly statically stable regions such as the the nocturnal boundary layer, the Richardson number can be large enough that turbulence is suppressed, and the flow is laminar over a layer many tens of meters thick.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

The mediators of bioturbation are typically annelid worms (e.g. polychaetes, oligochaetes), bivalves (e.g. mussels, clams), gastropods, holothurians, or any other infaunal or epifaunal organisms. Faunal activities, such as burrowing, ingestion and defecation of sediment grains, construction and maintenance of galleries, and infilling of abandoned dwellings, displace sediment grains and mix the sediment matrix.

cryoturbation,"Cryoturbation (frost churning) refers to the mixing of materials from various horizons of the soil right down to the parent rock due to freezing and thawing. Cryoturbation occurs to varying degrees in most Gelisols (permafrost soils). The cause of crytoturbation lies in the way in which the repeated freezing of the soil during autumn causes the formation of ice wedges at the most easily erodible parts of the parent rock. If the parent rock is hard, this can cause quite deep erosion of the rock over many years. As this process continues, during the summer when an active layer forms in the soil this eroded material can easily move both from the soil surface downward and from the permafrost table upward. As this process occurs, the upper soil material gradually dries out (because the soil moisture moves from the warm surface layer to the colder layer at the phen of the permafrost) so that it forms a granular structure with many very distinctive crystalline shapes (such as ice lenses). Separation of coarse from fine soil materials produces distinctive patterned ground with different types of soil.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

Although similar in form to atmospheric longitudinal roll vortices, Langmuir circulations are thought to be driven by nonlinear interactions between the surface gravity wave field and the larger-scale turbulent motions within the mixed layer. They are sometimes called windrows because they form lines of surface debris or bubbles in their surface convergence zones. Their spatial scale is related to the depth of the mixed layer and their characteristic velocity is on the order of 8u*, where u* is the friction velocity in water. As a result of this scaling, Langmuir circulations generally require surface winds of at least 8 m s-1 in order to form.

coral reef,"The term coral reef generally refers to a marine ecosystem in which the main organisms are corals that house algal symbionts within their tissues. These ecosystems require: 1) fully marine waters; 2) warm temperatures; and 3) ample sunlight. They are therefore restricted to shallow waters of tropical and subtropical regions. Corals that do not have algal symbionts can also form significant reef communities in deeper, darker, and colder waters, but these communities are distinguished as cold-water coral bioherms. The more technical definition of coral reef includes an additional geological requirement that the reef organisms produce enough calcium carbonate to build the physical reef structure. The coral reef community lives only on the surface veneer of the reef, on top of already existing skeletal material left behind by previous reef-builders. Many processes act to break down the skeletal material and reef as soon it is laid down by organisms. These include mechanical processes such as waves and currents, and a wide array of biological processes (e.g., bioerosion). Some of the best known bioeroders are large organisms such as parrotfish and sponges, but much of the bioerosion occurs at the microscopic scale by organisms such as algae and fungi. A coral reef is produced only if the coral reef community produces more calcium carbonate than is removed. Indeed, some coral reef communities grow too slowly to build a reef.",Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology Ontology.json,1

savanna,"A savanna or savannah is a tropical or subtropical woodland ecosystem. Savannas are characterised by the trees being sufficiently small or widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. It is often believed that savannas are characterized by widely spaced, scattered trees, however in many savanna communities tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forest communities.

fjord,"A fjord (or fiord) is a long, narrow estuary with steep sides, made when a glacial valley is filled by rising sea water levels. The seeds of a fjord are laid when a glacier cuts a U-shaped valley through abrasion of the surrounding bedrock by the sediment it carries. Many such valleys were formed during recent ice age when the sea was at a much lower level than it is today. At the end of the ice age, the climate warmed up again and glaciers retreated.

Bars can appear in the sea, in a lake, or in a river. Alternatively a bar may separate a lake from the sea, as in the case of an ayre. They are typically composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders).

solar coordinates,"Specifications for a location on the solar surface.  The location of a specific feature on the Sun (for example, a sunspot) is complicated by the fact that there is a tilt of 7.25 degrees between the ecliptic plane and the solar equatorial plane as well as a true wobble of the solar rotational axis. (Only twice a year are the solar north pole and the celestial north pole aligned.)  Consequently, to specify a location on the solar surface, three coordinates (P, B, L) are necessary to define a grid. Daily values for the coordinates in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) are listed in The Astronomical Almanac published annually by the U.S. Naval Observatory. The terms used to refer to the coordinates are defined as follows:
P-angle:  The position angle between the geocentric north pole and the solar rotational north pole measured eastward from geocentric north. The range in P is plus or minus 26.31°.
Bo:   Heliographic latitude of the central point of the solar disk; also called the B-angle. The range of B is plus or minus 7.23°, correcting for the tilt of the ecliptic with respect to the solar equatorial plane.
Example:  If (P, B) = (-26.21°, -6.54°), the heliographic latitude of the central point on the solar disk is -6.54° (the north rotational pole is not visible), and the angle between the projection onto the disk of the geocentric north pole and the solar north rotational pole is 26.21° to the west.
 L:   Heliographic longitude of the central point of the solar disk. The longitude value is determined with reference to a system of fixed longitudes rotating on the Sun at a rate of 13.2 degrees/day (the mean rate of rotation observed from central meridian transits of sunspots). The standard meridian on the Sun is defined to be the meridian that passed through the ascending node of the Sun’s equator on 1 January 1854 at 1200 UTC and is calculated for the present day by assuming a uniform sidereal period of rotation of 25.38 days.  Once P, B, and L are known, the latitude, central meridian distance, and longitude of a specific solar feature can be determined as follows:
Latitude.  The angular distance from the solar equator, measured north or south along the meridian.
Central meridian distance (CMD).  The angular distance in solar longitude measured from the central meridian. This position is relative to the view from Earth and will change as the Sun rotates. Therefore, this coordinate should not be confused with heliographic positions that are fixed with respect to the solar surface.
Longitude.  The angular distance from a standard meridian (0 degrees heliographic longitude), measured from east to west (0 to 360 degrees) along the Sun’s equator. It is computed by combining CMD with the longitude of the central meridian at the time of the observation, interpolating between ephemeris values (for 0000 UT) by using the synodic rate of solar rotation (27.2753 days, 13.2 degrees/day).",Space Weather Glossary.json,1

However, Neptune and the ex-planet Pluto do not conform to the rule. The question of whether there is any physical significance to the 'law,' i.e. some dynamical reason that will explain planetary orbit spacing has led to much discussion during the past two centuries.

tidal friction,"The friction exerted on a primary body (Earth) because of the phase lag between the tides and the gravitational attraction of the secondary body (Moon). The Earth's rotation is faster than the Moon's orbital motion; therefore the Earth's tidal bulges lead the Moon on its orbit. This has two important effects: The Earth is being pulled slightly 'back' from its sense of rotation. So the Earth's rotation slows (by about 1 second every 50,000 years). Moreover, the Moon is being pulled slightly 'forward' on its orbit. So it is harder for the Earth to hold it in place, and it moves further away from the Earth (by about 3-4 cm per yr). Tidal friction tends to synchronize the rotation period of a close-in companion with the period of its orbital motion around the primary.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

dark energy,"A hypothetical form of energy that fills all the space and tends to increase the rate of expansion of the Universe. Assuming the existence of dark energy is a way to explain recent observations that the Universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate. Dark energy seems to be a kind of anti-gravity force and is supposed to be related to vacuum energy. Where gravity pulls things together at the more local level, dark energy tears them apart on the grander scale. The acceleration equation, one of Einstein's equations for the homogeneous Universe, indicates that if the Universe is accelerating, the pressure of the driving component should be strongly negative.  The first indication of dark energy was provided by the observation of Type Ia supernovae. Other probes of dark energy are: baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and clusters of galaxies. In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy currently accounts for almost 74% of the total mass-energy of the Universe. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant and exotic component such as quintessence.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
quintessence,"In cosmology, a hypothetical new 'element,' distinct from any normal matter (either baryonic or not) or radiation, intended to explain the observed ever accelerating expansion of the Universe. Quintessence can have several types and differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In modern physics, the four known ""elements"" are the baryons (proton, neutron, etc.), the leptons (neutrinos, electrons, etc.), the photon, and the hypothetical non-baryonic matter, which is thought to be 80% of the total matter in the Universe. The quintessence field is a possibility which can be confirmed or disproved by measurements of the dark energy value at different redshifts. In some models, the quintessence is fine-tuned to explain both the cosmological constant problem and the inflation in the very early Universe.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

baryon acoustic oscillations,"In cosmology, one of a series of peaks and troughs that are present in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations after the recombination era, and on large scales. At the time of the Big Bang, and for about 380,000 years afterwards, Universe was ionized and photons and baryons were tightly coupled. Acoustic oscillations arose from perturbations in the primordial plasma due to the competition between gravitational attraction and gas+photons pressure. After the epoch of recombination, these oscillations froze and imprinted their signatures in both the CMB and matter distribution. In the case of the photons, the acoustic mode history is manifested as the high-contrast Doppler peaks in the temperature anisotropies. As for baryons, they were in a similar state, and when mixed with the non-oscillating cold dark matter perturbations, they left a small residual imprint in the clustering of matter on very large scales, ~100 h^-1 Mpc (h being the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The phenomenon of BAOs, recently discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, is a confirmation of the current model of cosmology. Like Type Ia supernovae, BAOs provide a standard candle for determining cosmic distances.

They divided the sample into two classes using the ratio RFR of the distance between the regions of highest surface brightness on opposite sides of the central galaxy or quasar, to the total extent of the source up to the lowest brightness contour in the map. Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FR-I) , Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FR-II). The boundary between the two classes is not very sharp, and there is some overlap in the luminosities of sources classified as FR-I or FR-II on the basis of their structures.

Nearby galaxy clusters such as the Virgo, Fornax, Centaurus, and Coma clusters contain hundreds to thousands of individual dSph galaxies. These galaxies have very low surface brightnesses, as low as only 1% that of the sky background. They are also among the smallest, least luminous galaxies known. Most of the radiation from dSph galaxies is emitted by stars in the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The lack of strong emission lines, infrared, or radio emission suggests that these galaxies are generally devoid of interstellar medium. The velocities of stars within dSph galaxies are so high that them must be disrupting. However, the bulk of mass in these galaxies might be undetected. Dynamical models that include dark matter do adequately explain the velocity dispersion of the stars in all dSph systems. In the most extreme cases, only 1% of the mass of the galaxy is visible.

The nature of the hypervelocity stars  (HVSs) spans a wide range of types from OB stars, to metal-poor F-type stars and G/K dwarfs. While there is evidence from many late-type B HVSs in the halo to originate from the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), other HVSs seem to originate from the galactic disk. HVSs can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes: 1) Tidal disruption of close binary stars by the central SMBH of the Milky Way. In this process one star is captured by the SMBH while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism. 2) Exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our Galaxy. 3) Disruption of close binaries via supernova explosions.

hickson compact group,,Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
local group,"A small galaxy cluster of about 50 galaxies to which our Milky Way galaxy belongs. The Local Group occupies a volume of space nearly 10 million light-years across centered somewhere between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way, which are the dominant galaxies of the group; Andromeda being the principal member. Both of these galaxies exhibit spiral structures, and each is attended by a large family of satellite dwarf galaxies. The Local Group also includes a third spiral galaxy known as Triangulum (M33), which is bound to Andromeda. The remaining members span a range of Hubble classification types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc and cover a factor of 10 in metallicity. The total mass of the Local Group is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 solar masses, although this value is still uncertain to within a factor of about 2. The velocities of the individual galaxies of the Local Group are not particularly high. Therefore no member is believed to be able to escape the group, which is thus considered to be gravitationally bound. Another remarkable member of the Group is IC 10.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
magellanic clouds,Two irregular satellite galaxies of our own Galaxy which are visible from the Southern Hemisphere as misty patches in the night sky.,Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
large magellanic cloud,"The larger of the two Magellanic Cloud galaxies visible in the southern hemisphere at about 22 degrees from the South Celestial Pole. It is approximately on the border between the constellations Dorado and Mensa in a region of faint stars. The center of the LMC is approximately RA: 5h 23m 35s, dec: -69° 45' 22''. The LMC shines with a total apparent visual magnitude of approximately zero. It spans an area of the sky about 9 by 11 degrees, corresponding to about 30,000 light-years across in the longest dimension, for a distance of some 162,000 light-years. It has a visible mass of about one-tenth that of our own Galaxy (10^10 M_sun). The LMC and its twin, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are two of our most prominent Galactic neighbors. The LMC is classified as a disrupted barred spiral galaxy of type SBm, the prototype of a class of Magellanic spirals. The galaxy is characterized by a prominent offset stellar bar located near its center with the dominant spiral arm to the north with two ""embryonic"" arms situated to the south. The metallicity in the LMC is known to be lower than in the solar neighborhood by a factor 2 or more. Based on 20 eclipsing binary systems, the distance to the LMC is measured to one percent precision to be 49.59±0.09 (statistical) ±0.54 (systematic) kpc.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

More specifically, massive stars inject energy, mass, and metals back to the interstellar medium through stellar winds and supernova explosions. Feedback inhibits further star formation either by removing gas from the galaxy, or by heating it to temperatures that are too high to form new stars. Observations reveal feedback in the form of galactic-scale outflows of gas in galaxies with high star formation rates, especially in the early Universe. Feedback in faint, low-mass galaxies probably facilitated the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies when the Universe was about 500 million years old, so that the hydrogen between galaxies changed from neutral to ionized, a process called reionization.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

In the case of starbursts, galactic winds are powered by stellar winds driven by massive stars and supernova explosions. Galaxy winds contain a mixture of extremely hot metal-enriched supernova ejecta and cooler entrained gas and dust. Outflowing material has been observed at great distances from galaxies (10 to 100 kpc). In some cases they escape the galaxy potential well and pollute the intergalactic medium with heavy elements.

hawking radiation,"The radiation produced by a black hole when quantum mechanical effects are taken into account. According to quantum physics, large fluctuations in the vacuum energy occurs for brief moments of time. Thereby virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are created from vacuum and annihilated. If pair production happens just outside the event horizon of a black hole, as soon as these particles are formed they would both experience drastically different gravitational attractions due to the sharp gradient of force close to the black hole. One particle will accelerate toward the black hole and its partner will escape into space. The black hole used some of its gravitational energy to produce these two particles, so it loses some of its mass if a particle escapes. This gradual loss of mass over time means the black hole eventually evaporates out of existence.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

photon sphere,"A surface where if a photon is emitted from one of its points the photon follows a closed orbit and returns periodically to its departure point. Such a surface exists only near sufficiently compact objects where the curvature of space-time is very important. In other words, a body can take a stable orbit around a black hole provided that it moves with the speed of light. However, only photons can have such a velocity; hence the term 'photon sphere.' For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, the photon sphere has a radius of R = 3GM/c2 = 3 RS/2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass, c is the speed of light, and RS is the Schwarzschild radius. For a rotating, Kerr black hole, the situation is much more complex due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In that case circular paths exist for radii whose values depend on the rotation direction. More specifically, in the equatorial plane there are two possible circular light paths: a smaller one in the direction of the rotation, and a larger one in the opposite direction.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

The other mirror, the index mirror, moves with an index arm pivoted at the center of the arc. The index arm is equipped with a vernier which moves along the limb. An object in direction S can be observed in the telescope through the un-silvered portion of the horizon glass. By moving the index arm, the second object S' is made to coincide with S in the telescope. According to the law of reflection, the angle between S and S' is double the angle between the mirrors. The angular distance between the objects can therefore be obtained from the measurement of angles between the planes of the mirrors.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

Hubble: ellipticals (E), spirals (S), barred spirals (SB), and irregulars (Ir). Later on a separate class of lenticulars (S0) was appended as an intermediate type between ellipticals and spirals. The sequence starts with round elliptical galaxies (E0). Flatter galaxies are arranged following a number which is calculated from the ratio (a - b)/a, where a and b are the major and minor axes as measured on the sky. Ellipticals are divided into eight categories (E0, E1, ..., E7). Beyond E7 a clear disk is apparent in the lenticular (S0) galaxies. The sequence then splits into two parallel branches of disk galaxies showing spiral structure: ordinary spirals, S, and barred spirals, SB. The spiral and barred types are subdivided into Sa, Sb, Sc, and SBa, SBb, SBc, respectively. Along the sequence from Sa to Sc, the central bulge becomes smaller, while the spiral arms become more and more paramount. The original, erroneous idea that such arrangement of the galaxies might represent an evolutionary sequence led to the ellipticals being referred to as early-type galaxies, and the spirals and Irr I irregulars as late-type galaxies.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

kappa mechanism,"A process based on the effects of opacity (κ) that drives the pulsations of many types of variable stars. Consider a layer of material within a star and suppose that it undergoes inward contraction. This inward motion tends to compress the layer and increase the density. Therefore the layer becomes more opaque. If a certain amount of flux comes from the deeper layers it gets stuck in the high κ region. The energy accumulates and heat builds up beneath it. The pressure rises below the layer, pushing it outward. The layer expands as it moves outward, cools and becomes more transparent to radiation. Energy can now escape from below the layer, and pressure beneath the layer diminishes. The layer falls inward and the cycle repeats. The κ mechanism is believed to account for the pulsations of several star families, including Delta Scuti stars, Beta Cephei variables, Cepheids, and RR Lyrae stars.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

hertzsprung russell diagram,"A display of stellar properties using a plot of effective temperature (or instead color or spectral type) along the abscissa versus luminosity (or absolute magnitude). The temperature is plotted in the inverse direction, with high temperatures on the left and low temperatures on the right. On the diagram the majority of stars are concentrated in a diagonal strip running from upper left to lower right, i.e. from high temperature-high luminosity massive stars to low temperature-low luminosity low-mass stars. This feature is known as the main sequence. This is the locus of stars burning hydrogen in their cores (proton-proton chain). The lower edge of this strip, known as the zero age main sequence (ZAMS), designates the positions where stars of different mass first begin to burn hydrogen in their cores. Well below the main sequence there is a group of stars that, despite being very hot, are so small that their luminosity is very small as a consequence. These are the class of white dwarfs. These objects represent old and very evolved stars that have shed their outer layers to reveal a very small but extremely hot inner core. They are no longer generating energy but are merely emitting light as they cool (white dwarf cooling track). Stars with high luminosities but relatively low temperatures occupy a wide region above the main sequence. The majority of them have used up all the hydrogen in their cores and have expanded and cooled as a result of internal readjustment. Called red giants, they are still burning helium in their cores (helium burning, carbon burning). There are also stars with very high luminosities, resulting from their enormous outputs of energy, because they are burning their fuel at a prodigious rate. These are the supergiants. They can be hot or cool, hence blue or red in color.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
asymptotic giant branch,"A region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram populated by evolving low-mass to intermediate-mass stars. These stars have an electron degenerate core of carbon and oxygen surrounded by two burning shells of helium and hydrogen. The H and He-burning shells are activated alternately in the deep layers of the star. An extended and tenuous convection envelope, having a radius of 10^4 - 10^5 times the size of the core, lies above these shells. The loosely bound envelope is gradually eroded by the strong stellar wind, which forms a dusty circumstellar envelope out to several hundreds of stellar radii. The convective envelope, stellar atmosphere, and circumstellar envelope have a rich and changing chemical composition provided by nucleosynthesis processes in the burning shells in the deep interior.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

horizontal branch,"A set of roughly horizontal points in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of a typical globular cluster. It displays a stage of stellar evolution which immediately follows the red giant branch (RGB) in stars with an initial mass < 1.2 M_sun. When the star's ascent of the RGB is terminated by the helium flash, it moves down to the Horizontal Branch (HB). The star's effective temperature on the HB is higher than it was on the RGB, but the luminosity is considerably less than at the helium flash. Usually HB stars have two energy sources: in addition to the helium burning in their cores, they experience hydrogen fusion in a surrounding shell. The thickness of the shell determines the color of the HB stars. A thin shell, involving low opacity, makes the star look blue. The HB domain encompasses a very large effective temperature range with several members: extreme HB, blue HB, RR Lyrae, red HB, and red clump stars. The locations depend on many parameters, including stellar mass, metallicity, age, helium abundance, and rotation.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
instability strip,"A narrow, almost vertical, band on the right hand side of the main sequence in the H-R diagram occupied by many different types of pulsating stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheids, W Virginis, ZZ Ceti). Stars traverse this region at least once after they leave the main sequence. The narrow temperature range of the instability strip corresponds to the stellar effective temperature that can sustain partial ionization zones, capable of maintaining stellar oscillations. The blue (hot) edge of the instability strip pertains to stars with surface temperatures hotter than ~7500 K. Because these stars have partial ionization zones too close to their surface, the pulsation mechanism is not active. The red (cooler) edge of the instability strip is determined by stars with a temperature lower than ~5500 K. In these stars convection prevents the build-up of heat pressure necessary to drive pulsations.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

von zeipel theorem,"A theorem that establishes a relation between the radiative flux at some colatitude on the surface of a rotating star and the local effective gravity (which is a function of the angular velocity and colatitude). For a rotating star in which centrifugal forces are not negligible, the equipotentials where gravity, centrifugal force, and pressure are balanced will no longer be spheres. The theorem states that the radiative flux is proportional to the local effective gravity at the considered colatitude, F(θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)α, where α is the gravity darkening coefficient. As a consequence, the stellar surface will not be uniformly bright, because there is a much larger flux and a higher effective temperature at the pole than at the equator (T_eff (θ) ∝ g_eff (θ)β, where β is the gravity darkening exponent.

Same as heliocentric parallax.  Because the Earth revolves around the Sun, we observe the sky from a constantly moving position in space. Therefore, we should expect to see an annual effect, in which the positions of nearby objects appear to oscillate back and forth in response to our motion around the Sun. This does in fact happen, but the distances to even the nearest stars are so great that we need to make careful observations with a telescope to detect it.

For a parallax angle p = 1'', the distance to the star would correspond to 206,264 AU. By convention, the distance unit parsec is defined to be equivalent to 206,264 AU.

eclipses,"The passage of the shadow of a celestial body over the surface of another. The maximum number of solar and lunar visible eclipses occurring annually is seven; the minimum number is two, both being solar. Solar eclipses take place when the new Moon is close to an orbital node and on the same longitude with the Sun. At that moment either the umbra, antumbra, or the penumbra touches the Earth's surface. For an observer located in the umbra the eclipse is total, while for one placed in the antumbra it is annular. Annular eclipses occur around lunar apogee. An observer situated in the penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. A total or annular eclipse can be seen from a band with a width of 270 km at the most, around which, the much larger partiality zone extends. The Moon's shadow crosses the Earth from west to east at about 3,200 km/h. During total eclipses the Sun's disk is entirely covered and the solar corona can be seen. A solar eclipse can last up to 3h (between the first and the fourth contacts). Totality has a theoretical maximum duration of 7m 31s, but it is usually shorter. A lunar eclipse can be seen from any place on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon; it occurs when the full Moon passes through the central dark shadow of the Earth. The Earth's shadow is much wider than the Moon and this is why the lunar eclipses can last up to four hours (between the first and the fourth contact).",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
annular eclipses,"A solar eclipse in which the Moon is close the apogee and is, therefore, too small to cover the whole disk of the Sun, leaving a visible edge or ring of sunlight. An annular eclipse can last for 12m 30s at the most.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
baily's beads,"A phenomenon that occurs during a total eclipse of the Sun. Just prior to and after totality, sunlight shines through the lunar valleys on the Moon's limb, causing the dark face of the Moon to appear to be surrounded by a shining 'necklace of pearls'.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
lunar eclipses,"The darkening of the Moon which occurs when the Moon enters the umbra of the Earth's shadow. This phenomenon can occur only when the full Moon is near one of the lunar nodes of its orbit around the Earth. There will be a total eclipse if the entire Moon enters the umbra, otherwise the eclipse will be partial when the Moon is somewhat to the north or south of the node and does not cross the shadow entirely. During the eclipse the Moon looks more or less dark, depending especially on the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. The refraction of Sun's light through the atmosphere sometimes gives a red color to the eclipsed Moon. Colored fringes can be seen around the shadow edge during partial eclipses. Because an eclipse of the Moon is due to the cutting off of the Sun's light, it is visible from the entire hemisphere where the Moon is above the horizon. The maximum duration of a total lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the shadow centrally, is 1h 47m.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
saros cycle,"The period of 223 synodic month, equaling 6585.32 days or 18 years, 11.33 days, after which the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to approximately the same relative geometry. When two eclipses are separated by a period of one Saros, they occur at the same node with the Moon at nearly the same distance from Earth and at the same time of year. Thus, the Saros is a useful tool for organizing eclipses into families or series. Each series typically lasts 12 or 13 centuries and contains 70 or more eclipses.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

flash spectra,"The spectrum of the solar chromosphere obtained during a solar eclipse in the instant before or after totality. In the flash spectrum the usual solar absorption lines are replaced with bright emission lines.

Young was the first to observe it during the solar eclipse of 1870 (December 22) in Spain.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

ligo,"A facility dedicated to the detection and measurement of cosmic gravitational waves. It consists of two widely separated installations, or detectors, within the United States, operated in unison as a single observatory. One installation is located in Hanford (Washington) and the other in Livingston (Louisiana), 3,000 km apart. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), LIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and by industrial contractors. Construction of the facilities was completed in 1999. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2001. Each LIGO detector beams laser light down arms 4 km long, which are arranged in the shape of an 'L.' If a gravitational wave passes through the detector system, the distance traveled by the laser beam changes by a minuscule amount -- less than one-thousandth of the size of an atomic nucleus (10^-18 m). Still, LIGO should be able to pick this difference up. LIGO directly detected gravitational waves for the first time from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on September 14, 2015. The Nobel Prize in physics 2017 was awarded to three physicists (Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne) for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.

walraven photometry,"A photometric system with five wavelength ranges that does not use filters. Instead it uses prisms and lenses (spectroscopy) to select the bands simultaneously. The wavelengths and the bandwidths are: W, 3250 and 140 Å; U, 3630 and 240 Å; L, 3840 and 230 Å; B, 4320 and 450 Å; and V, 5470 and 720 Å. The Walraven photometer was unique in design and remained literally unique as copies were never built. In addition, during its whole life the photometer was mounted permanently on the same telescope that had been built specifically for this instrument, the 91 cm 'Lightcollector' reflector, which started in 1958 at the Leiden Southern Station in Broederstroom, South-Africa. After 20 years in South-Africa the telescope and photometer were moved to the European Southern Observatory La Silla observatory in Chile. The photometric observations were resumed in March 1979 and continued for another 12 years until the decommissioning of the photometer in 1991.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

spectral energy distribution,"A plot showing the energy emitted by a source as a function of the radiation wavelength or frequency. It is used in many branches of astronomy to characterize astronomical sources, in particular mainly in near infrared and middle infrared to study protostars or young stellar objects. The SED of these objects is divided in four classes. Class 0 in which the SED represents a very embedded protostar, where the mass of the central core is small in comparison to the mass of the accreting envelope. The SED is characterized by the blackbody radiation of the envelope and peaks at submillimeter wavelengths. Class I objects possess a SED that peaks in the far infrared and is characterized by a weak contribution of the blackbody of the central protostar (detected in near infrared) and the emission of a thick disk and dense envelope. These objects have less mass in the envelope and more massive central cores with respect to Class 0. Class II objects are the classical T Tauri stars with a SED due to the emission of a thin disk and the central star. They have accumulated most of their final mass and have dispersed almost completely their circumstellar envelope. Finally, Class III objects have pure photospheric spectra. Their SED is peaked in the optical and is well approximated by a blackbody emission with a faint infrared excess due to the presence of a residual optically thin disk that may be the origin of planetesimals. This classification scheme can be made more quantitative by defining a spectral index.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

Over the course of several hours up to 10,000 billion kg of this material is ejected into interplanetary space with a speed of as high as 3000 km/s. CMEs are most spectacularly observed by a white light coronagraph located outside Earth's atmosphere. Such observations from Skylab in the early 1970's were the first to reveal this phenomenon. CME's disrupt the flow of the solar wind and can produce intense electromagnetic disturbances that can severely damage satellites and disrupt power grids on Earth.

As a comet orbits the Sun it sheds an icy, dusty debris stream along its orbit. When the Earth's orbit intersects the dust trail, more meteors are seen as the cometary debris encounters our planet's atmosphere. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by orbiting asteroids. Typical meteor showers show 15 to 100 meteors per hour at their peak. On very rare occasions, during a meteor storm, thousands of meteors fall per hour.

The faster-moving inside satellite accelerates the inner ring particles as it passes them, causing them to spiral out to larger orbits.

comets,"A small body of gas and dust which revolves around the Sun in a usually very elliptical or even parabolic orbit. It is seen to be composed of a head and often with a spectacular gaseous tail extending a great distance from the head. The rocky-icy head is called the comet nucleus. As the comet nears the Sun, the increased temperature causes the ice in the nucleus to sublimate and form a gaseous halo around the nucleus, called the coma. Comets often possess two tails, a dust tail that lies in the orbit behind the comet generated by surface activity, and a brighter, ionized gas tail, that points away from the Sun, driven by solar wind. Cometary reservoirs are thought to represent primordial solar system material. A comet with a dust coating on its surface that inhibits gas production might be classified as an asteroid. Because of this ambiguity, objects such as Chiron, Centaur asteroid, have been reclassified as comets. Comets are primarily composed of amorphous water ice, but also contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane at a few percent level (with respect to water), and many other molecules at a lower level.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

Its earliest recorded sighting is traced back to 240 BC in China. In 1705 Edmond Halley used Newton's new theory of gravitation to determine the orbits of comets from their recorded positions in the sky as a function of time. He found that the bright comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 had almost the same orbits. He concluded that these appearances must belong to a single recurring comet, and predicted its return for 1758.

comet nuclei,"The solid, centrally located part of a comet. The nucleus is a mass of dust and frozen gases. When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma, which is later swept into an elongated tail. Reliable measurements of cometary nuclei indicate sizes from a few km to 10 or 20 km. The nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp is one of the largest (perhaps 40 km). The composition of the nucleus is determined by measuring the composition of the coma (except for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko).

Its orbital period is 365.2563 days (sidereal year) and its eccentricity 0.017. Other characteristics: axial inclination 23.44°; rotation period 23.934 h (sidereal day); mean density 5.52 g/cm^3; mass 5.974 x 10^24 kg; escape velocity 11.18 km/s; average albedo 0.37.  The Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.9% argon, plus carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and other gases in much smaller quantities. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 1,000 mbar.

Over 5,000 active volcanoes have been registered throughout man's known history. The outer layer of the planet, the lithosphere, is covered with the crust. In the upper mantle and beneath the lithosphere, lies asthenosphere. Convection in the asthenosphere has caused plate tectonics motions and continent drifts. The densest layer of the Earth is its core, about 3000 km to 6400 km beneath the surface, consisting primarily of iron and nickel.

mercury (planet),"The closest planet to the Sun and one of five planets visible with the naked eye. The greatest elongation of Mercury is about 28°, making it visible at most about 112 minutes after sunset or before sunrise. It lies at a mean distance of about 0.39 astronomical units from the Sun. Mercury is just 4,879 km in diameter, about 2.6 times smaller than the Earth. Its orbital period is 87.97 Earth days. Mercury has a high density, 5.4 g cm^-3, with only the Earth having a higher density among the planets. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock. One solar day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km. Mercury has just 38% the gravity of Earth, this is too little to maintain an atmosphere against solar winds, which blow it away. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun has temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. Mercury's core has more iron than any other planet in the solar system. This has to do with its formation and early life.

globular star clusters,"A spherical aggregate of stars made up of thousands to a few million stars which is an orbiting satellite of a galaxy. There are over 150 globular clusters orbiting our galaxy. Globular clusters are gravitationally bound systems, highly concentrated to the center (up to a few 10^3 stars per cubic light-years), with a volume ranging from a few dozen up to more than 300 light-years in diameter. They are generally old and metal-poor and are among the first objects to be formed in a galaxy. There is also strong evidence that they form in major galaxy interactions and mergers. The stars in a globular cluster are thought to have a common origin and thus a single age and chemical abundance; with some exceptions such as Omega Centauri and NGC 2808, which exhibit multiple populations. The presence of various sub-populations within a globular cluster is interpreted as indicating distinct epochs of mass accretion and/or major star formation. The Milky Way hosts about 200 globular clusters. They are spherically distributed about the Galactic Center up to a radius of 350 light-years, with a maximum concentration toward the Galactic center. All but the smallest dwarf galaxies possess globular clusters. Some galaxies, e.g. M87, contain several thousands of them. There are, however, important differences. While all the globular clusters in our Galaxy and in M31 are old (ages of about 10 billion years, at least), there are galaxies, such as the two Magellanic Clouds and M33, that host much younger globular clusters (ages of a few billion years, or less).",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

Stars do not necessarily rotate as solid bodies, and their angular momentum may be distributed non-uniformly, depending on radius or latitude.

gravity darkening,"The darkening, or brightening, of a region on a star due to localized decrease, or increase, in the effective gravity. Gravity darkening is explained by the von Zeipel theorem, whereby on stellar surface the radiative flux is proportional to the effective gravity. This means that in rotating stars regions close to the pole are brighter (and have higher temperature) than regions close to the equator. Gravity darkening occurs also in corotating binary systems, where the tidal force leads to both gravity darkening and gravity brightening. The effects are often seen in binary star light curves. Recent theoretical work has shown that gravity darkening is not well represented by the von Zeipel theorem. This is supported by new interferometric observations of some rapidly rotating stars indicating that the von Zeipel theorem seems to overestimate the temperature difference between the poles and equator.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

population ii cepheid variable stars,,Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1
population iii stars,"A member of the first generation of stars, formed out of pristine gas, enriched by primordial nucleosynthesis alone. The material from which these stars formed consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. Because neutral hydrogen clouds were free of dust, their cooling mechanism was drastically ineffective. As a result, these star forming clouds had a much higher temperature than in the present epoch, and their Jeans mass was much higher. Therefore, these first generation of stars were principally massive, with a typical mass scale of order of about 100 M_sun. Population III stars started forming about 300 million years after the Big Bang at redshifts between 50 and 6, when the Universe had between 1 and 5% of its present age. These stars were probably responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Given their high mass, they lived only a few million years ending with either a pair-instability supernova phase or a direct collapse to a black hole. Population III stars thus initiated the chemical enrichment of the Universe and opened the way to more normal modes of star formation, namely Population II.

Bodies with masses less than Chandrasekhar's limit (1.4 solar masses) are supported by electron degeneracy pressure and have densities of about 10^6 kg/m^3. In collapsed stars of mass above 1.4 solar masses, gravity will overwhelm electron degeneracy and further collapse ensues. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, so producing a neutron star. Because neutrons, like electrons, are fermions and therefore subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, at high enough densities, about 10^14 kg/m^3, neutron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse of the star. For masses larger than 2-3 solar masses, even neutron degeneracy cannot prevent further collapse, and a black hole is formed.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

cemp stars,"A star that presents very low iron abundances [Fe/H] < -4 but an anomalous richness in carbon. CEMP stars have been defined as a subset of metal-poor stars that exhibit elevated [C/Fe] ≥ +1.0. It has been recognized that ~15-20% of stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0 are carbon enhanced. This fraction rises to 30% for [Fe/H] < -3.0, to 40% for [Fe/H] < -3.5, and ~75% for [Fe/H] < -4.0. This increasing trend of CEMP-star frequency with declining [Fe/H] is confirmed by the observation of many thousands of CEMP stars.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

massive stars,"A star whose mass is larger than approximately 10 solar masses. The spectral types of massive stars range from about B3 (B star) to O2 (O star) and include Wolf-Rayet stars as well as Luminous Blue Variables. Massive stars are very rare; for each star of 20 solar masses there are some 100,000 stars of 1 solar mass. Despite this rarity, they play a key role in astrophysics. They are major sites of nucleosynthesis beyond oxygen and, therefore, are mainly responsible for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Due to their high ultraviolet flux and powerful stellar winds, they bring about interesting phenomena in the interstellar medium, like H II regions, turbulence, shocks, bubbles, and so on. Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae (type Ia, type Ic and type II), neutron stars, and black holes. The formation processes of massive stars is still an unresolved problem. For massive stars the accretion time scale is larger than the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale. This means that massive stars reach the main sequence while accretion is still going on.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

brown dwarfs,"A star-like object whose mass is too small to sustain hydrogen fusion in its interior and become a star. Brown dwarfs are substellar objects and occupy an intermediate regime between those of stars and giant planets. With a mass less than 0.08 times that of the Sun (about 80 Jupiter masses), nuclear reactions in the core of brown dwarfs are limited to the transformation of deuterium into Helium-3. The reason is that the cores of these objects are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure (at early spectral types) and Coulomb pressure (at later spectral types). Brown dwarfs, as ever cooling objects, will have late M dwarf spectral types within a few Myrs of their formation and gradually evolve as L, T and Y dwarfs brown dwarf cooling. As late-M and early-L dwarfs, they overlap in temperature with the cool end of the stellar main sequence (M dwarf, L dwarf, T dwarf, Y dwarf).

red giant stars,"A certain star of spectral type K or later that occupies the upper right portion of the H-R diagram. Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted their hydrogen fuel in the core. They may have a luminosity up to 1000 times greater than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. Red giants belong to the luminosity class III or II (bright giants). They are luminous because of their great size, but have a relatively low surface temperature. All normal stars are expected to pass eventually through a red-giant phase as a consequence of stellar evolution. When a main sequence star has converted approximately 10% of its hydrogen to helium, nuclear reactions in the core stop (Schönberg-Chandrasekhar limit). The hydrostatic equilibrium is no longer maintained, and the core contracts while the outer layers expand and cool. This process produces the low surface temperature and large size (from 10 to 100 times that of the Sun) that characterize the red giant. In the core the temperature continues to rise. When it approaches 100,000,000 K helium will begin to fuse into carbon. Prominent bright red giants in the night sky include Aldebaran and Arcturus.",Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT).json,1

yellow hypergiant stars,"An evolved, very massive star of spectral type F or G with a very high luminosity (~10^5 times solar) lying near the empirical upper luminosity boundary in the H-R diagram (Humphreys-Davidson limit). Yellow hypergiants have high mass loss rates (10^-5 - 10^-3 solar masses per year) and are in a short, transitional evolutionary stage. Their evolutionary state is thought to correspond to post-red supergiants rapidly evolving in blueward loops in the H-R diagram. In their post-RSG blueward evolution these stars enter a temperature range (6000-9000 K), called yellow void, with increased dynamical instability. Their link to other advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars such as Luminous Blue Variables and Wolf-Rayet stars is still an open issue in stellar evolution theory.

These stars expand and contract at extremely regular periods, in the range 1-50 days. Their highest brightness and surface temperature occur when their expansion velocity is greatest. Similarly, their minima in brightness and temperature occur when they are in the contraction phase. The longer the period, the more luminous the star. The process that drives the pulsation of Cepheid variables is the kappa mechanism. In fact, Cepheids provide one of the most powerful tools for measuring distances to other galaxies (period-luminosity relation). However, this method is limited to the distance of the Virgo cluster of galaxies (15-20 Mpc) even with the HST or the largest ground-based telescopes.

The changes in brightness are accompanied by and principally caused by changes in stellar temperature and also by changes in radius. δ Cephei was actually the second Cepheid variable to be discovered. The first one, Eta Aquilae, had been discovered earlier the same year by Edward Pigott. δ Cephei varies with a period of 5.366341 days (or 5 days 8 hours 37.5 minutes) from magnitude 3.48, spectral type F5 Ib in its maximum to magnitude 4.37, spectral type G2 Ib in its minimum.
